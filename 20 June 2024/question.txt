QUESTION:

Integral Points Inside Triangle

Given three non-collinear points whose co-ordinates are 
p(p1, p2), q(q1, q2) and r(r1, r2) in the X-Y plane. 
Return the number of integral (lattice) points strictly 
inside the triangle formed by these points.

Note: - A point in the X-Y plane is said to be an integral (lattice) point if both its coordinates are integral.
