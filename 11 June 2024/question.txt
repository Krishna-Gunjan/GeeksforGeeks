QUESTION:

Maximum Tip Calculator

In a restaurant, two waiters, A and B, receive n orders per day,
earning tips as per arrays arr[i] and brr[i] respectively. 
If A takes the ith order, the tip is arr[i] rupees; 
if B takes it, the tip is brr[i] rupees.

To maximize total tips, they must distribute the orders such that:

    A can handle at most x orders
    B can handle at most y orders

Given that x + y â‰¥ n, all orders can be managed by either A or B. 
Return the maximum possible total tip after processing all the orders.
