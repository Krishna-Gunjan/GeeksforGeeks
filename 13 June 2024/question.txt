QUESTION:

Padovan Sequence

Given a number n, find the nth number in the Padovan Sequence.

    A Padovan Sequence is a sequence which is represented by the following recurrence relation
    P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
    P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1

Note: Since the output may be too large, compute the answer modulo 10^9+7.
