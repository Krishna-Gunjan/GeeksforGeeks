A matrix is constructed of size n*n and given an integer ‘q’. 
The value at every cell of the matrix is given as, M(i,j) = i+j, 
where ‘M(i,j)' is the value of a cell, ‘i’ is the row number, 
and ‘j’ is the column number. Return the number of cells having value ‘q’.

Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.
