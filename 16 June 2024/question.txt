QUESTION:

Prime Pair with Target Sum

Given a number n, find out if n can be expressed as a+b,
where both a and b are prime numbers.
If such a pair exists, return the values of a and b,
otherwise return [-1,-1] as an array of size 2.

Note: If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, 
and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, 
and a < c then  [a, b] is considered as our answer.
